# Frontend Development Guide

This guide outlines the approach for developing frontends for the Filecoin Starter Kits.

## Individual Frontends (In Progress)

Each starter kit will have its own frontend to demonstrate its specific functionality. These frontends are currently under development and have not yet been completed:

1. FEVM Hardhat Kit Frontend (In progress)
2. FEVM Foundry Kit Frontend (In progress)
3. FVM Starter Kit (Deal Making) Frontend (In progress)
4. RaaS Starter Kit Frontend (In progress)
5. State Storage Starter Kit Frontend (In progress)

## Unified Hub

A unified hub will be developed to showcase all starter kits and provide a comprehensive view of the Filecoin ecosystem.

## Development Guidelines

1. Use React for all frontend development
2. Maintain consistent styling across all frontends
3. Create reusable components in the `shared/` directory
4. Follow the project's code style guidelines (see [Code Style Guide](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md))
